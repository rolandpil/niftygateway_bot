# niftygateway_bot (_depricated_)

Bot used for entering mass accounts into niftygateway drawings in early 2021.

https://www.niftygateway.com/

This was one of my first times using selenium to automate tasks. I later used the requests library to enter drawings as it was much faster and more efficient than selenium.

# What I learned

- Web scraping with selenium
- Using requests to navigate and interact with websites
- Using the https://smspva.com api to generate and verify phone numbers
