# NiftyGateway Bot (_depricated_)

Bot used for creating, verifying, and entering mass accounts into https://www.niftygateway.com/ drawings in early 2021.

This was one of my first times using selenium to automate tasks. I later used the requests library to enter drawings as it was much faster and more efficient than selenium.

# What I learned

- Web scraping with selenium
- Using requests to navigate and interact with websites
- Using the https://smspva.com api to generate and verify phone numbers
